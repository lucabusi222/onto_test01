title: "IL-33–activated eosinophil EVs reprogram tumor cells"
short_handle: "Eo33-EV_reprogramming"
biological_rationale: >
  IL-33 activation of eosinophils increases EV output and changes EV cargo.
  Tumor cells that internalize these EVs upregulate CDKI genes, arrest in G0/G1,
  adopt epithelial-like features, and show reduced proliferation/migration and metastasis.
system:
  species: 
    - Mus musculus
    - Homo sapiens (tumor cell lines)
  cell_types:
    donor_cells:
      - Eosinophil (mouse, human)
    recipient_cells:
      - Tumor cells (mouse, human)
  microenvironment:
    - 2D culture
    - Tumor spheroids (3D)
    - Syngeneic mouse model (lung metastasis readout)
perturbations:
  stimuli_to_donor_cells:
    - name: IL-33
      role: activation
      control: IL-5 activation (comparative)
  derived_particles:
    - name: extracellular vesicles
      subtypes:
        - Eo33-EV: EVs from IL-33–activated eosinophils
        - Eo5-EV: EVs from IL-5–activated eosinophils (control)
assays_and_readouts:
  uptake: EV incorporation by tumor cells (qual/quant)
  cell_cycle:
    - CDKI gene expression ↑
    - G0/G1 arrest
  proliferation: ↓
  spheroid_formation: ↓
  migration_morphology:
    - E-cadherin ↑
    - N-cadherin ↓
    - Cell elongation ↓
    - Migratory extent ↓
  transcriptomics_EV:
    - RNA-seq of EV cargo
    - Eo33-EV enriched for tumor suppressor mRNAs; epithelial/negative-regulation pathways
  in_vivo:
    - syngeneic injection of treated tumor cells → lung metastases ↓
controls:
  - EVs from IL-5–activated eosinophils (Eo5-EV)
  - vehicle/no-EV control
hypotheses:
  - IL-33 shifts eosinophil EV cargo toward tumor-suppressive programs.
  - Eo33-EV uptake induces epithelial-like, low-motility tumor phenotypes and cell-cycle arrest.
key_variables:
  - IL-33 dose/time
  - EV yield and normalization (per donor cell/protein/particle number)
  - Tumor cell line identity
  - EV:tumor cell ratio, exposure time
  - Readout timepoints
evidence_summary: >
  IL-33 increases EV production; Eo33-EV (but not Eo5-EV) drives CDKI upregulation, G0/G1 arrest,
  epithelial-like shift, reduced migration/spheroid formation, and reduced lung metastasis in mice.
  EV RNA-seq shows tumor-suppressor and epithelial/negative-regulation pathway enrichment in Eo33-EV.
